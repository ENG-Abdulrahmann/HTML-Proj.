            is human–computer interaction in which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which
            allows for the transmission of data, voice, and video. Mobile computing involves mobile communication,
            mobile hardware, and mobile software. Communication issues include ad hoc networks and infrastructure
            networks as well as communication properties, protocols, data formats, and concrete technologies. Hardware
            includes mobile devices or device components. Mobile software deals with the characteristics and
            requirements of mobile applications.
            Portability: Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system should facilitate mobility. These
            devices may have limited device capabilities and limited power supply but should have a sufficient
            processing capability and physical portability to operate in a movable environment.
            Connectivity: This defines the quality of service (QoS) of the network connectivity. In a mobile computing
            system, the network availability is expected to be maintained at a high level with a minimal amount of
            lag/downtime without being affected by the mobility of the connected nodes.
            Interactivity: The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected with one another to
            communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data.
            Individuality: A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network often denote an individual;
            a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the technology to cater to the individual needs and also
            to obtain contextual information of each node.

            Some of the most common forms of mobile computing devices are as given below:

            Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily
            intended as hosts for software that may be parameterized, such as laptops/desktops, smartphones/tablets,
            etc.
            Smart cards that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel, and secure area
            access.
            Mobile phones, telephony devices which can call from a distance through cellular networking technology.
            Wearable computers, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended as the incorporation of
            software agents, such as bracelets, key-less implants, etc.

            The wearable computer, Apple Watch, released in 2015
            These classes are expected to endure and to complement each other, none replacing another completely.

            Other types of mobile computers have been introduced since the 1990s, including the:

            Portable computer (discontinued)
            Personal digital assistant/Enterprise digital assistant (discontinued)
            Ultra-Mobile PC (discontinued)
            Laptop
            Smartphone and tablet computer
            Wearable computer
            E-reader
            Carputer

    <div id="Limitations">
        <p>
            Expandability, Replaceability and Modularity: In contrast to the common traditional motherboard-based PC the
            SoC architecture in which they are embedded makes impossible these features.
            Lack of a BIOS: As most smart devices lack a proper BIOS, their bootloading capabilities are limited as they
            can only boot into the single operative system with which it came, in contrast with the PC BIOS model.
            Range and bandwidth: Mobile Internet access is generally slower than direct cable connections, using
            technologies such as GPRS and EDGE, and more recently HSDPA, HSUPA, 3G and 4G networks and also the proposed
            5G network. These networks are usually available within a range of commercial cell phone towers. High-speed
            network wireless LANs are inexpensive but have a very limited range.
            Security standards: When working mobile, one is dependent on public networks, requiring careful use of VPN.
            Security is a major concern while concerning the mobile computing standards on the fleet. One can easily
            attack the VPN through a huge number of networks interconnected through the line.
            Power consumption: When a power outlet or portable generator is not available, mobile computers must rely
            entirely on battery power. Combined with the compact size of many mobile devices, this often means unusually
            expensive batteries must be used to obtain the necessary battery life.
            Transmission interferences: Weather, terrain, and the range from the nearest signal point can all interfere
            with signal reception. Reception in tunnels, some buildings, and rural areas is often poor.
            Potential health hazards: People who use mobile devices while driving are often distracted from driving and
            are thus assumed more likely to be involved in traffic accidents.[1] (While this may seem obvious, there is
            considerable discussion about whether banning mobile device use while driving reduces accidents.[2][3]) Cell
            phones may interfere with sensitive medical devices. Questions concerning mobile phone radiation and health
            have been raised.
            Human interface with device: Screens and keyboards tend to be small, which may make them hard to use.
            Alternate input methods such as speech or handwriting recognition require training.

    <div id="In-vehicle computing ">
        Many commercial and government field forces deploy a rugged portable computer with their fleet of vehicles. This
        requires the units to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety, device security, and ergonomics. Rugged
        computers are rated for severe vibration associated with large service vehicles and off-road driving and the
        harsh environmental conditions of constant professional use such as in emergency medical services, fire, and
        public safety.
        Other elements affecting function in the vehicle:

        Operating temperature: A vehicle cabin can often experience temperature swings from −30–60 °C (−22–140 °F).
        Computers typically must be able to withstand these temperatures while operating. Typical fan-based cooling has
        stated limits of 35–38 °C (95–100 °F) of ambient temperature and temperatures below freezing require localized
        heaters to bring components up to operating temperature (based on independent studies by the SRI Group and by
        Panasonic R&D).
        Vibration can decrease the life expectancy of computer components, notably rotational storage such as HDDs.
        Visibility of standard screens becomes an issue in bright sunlight.
        Touchscreen users easily interact with the units in the field without removing gloves.
        High-temperature battery settings: Lithium-ion batteries are sensitive to high-temperature conditions for
        charging. A computer designed for the mobile environment should be designed with a high-temperature charging
        function that limits the charge to 85% or less of capacity.
        External antenna connections go through the typical metal cabins of vehicles which would block wireless
        reception and take advantage of much more capable external communication and navigation equipment.
